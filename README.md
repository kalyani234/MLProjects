Logistic regression aims to solve classification problems. It does this by predicting categorical outcomes, unlike linear regression that predicts a continuous outcome.

In the simplest case there are two outcomes, which is called binomial,
an example of which is predicting if a tumor is malignant or benign.
Other cases have more than two outcomes to classify, in this case it is called multinomial.
A common example for multinomial logistic regression would be predicting the class of an iris flower between 3 different species.

Here we will be using basic logistic regression to predict a binomial variable. This means it has only two possible outcomes.

In the project we are predicting Submarine hitted by Rock or mine by considering the Sonar data of Rock and Mine by applying Logistic Regression Model
